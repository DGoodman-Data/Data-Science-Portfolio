VADER Sentiment Analysis Over IMDB Movie Reviews
Data Information: Unstructured text data containing stop words, punctuation, and other elements that require preprocessing.
Goal: Use VADER lexicon to interpret and predict the sentiment of each movie review
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
Results: My computer, a surface pro, is not powerful enough to analyze the entire 50,000 row dataset in the PyCharm IDE. 
         I instead analyzed the first 50 reviews and included a screenshot of the excel workbook results.
